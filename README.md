hi

To run first install dependencies:

```
pip[3] install pygame
pip[3] install pygame-menu
```

Then run `main.py`:

```
python[3] main.py
```

The `3` in square brackets may or may not be needed depending on your version of python install (If you have python 2 and python 3 installed, use `pip3` and `python3`, otherwise just `pip` and `python`)
